# Very Basic Flappy Bird game using Pygame
>I was learning pygame through [Clear Code's video](https://youtu.be/UZg49z76cLw), when it struck me that I could fix and change some of thee things in their code, and it would be a great learning opportunity for me, and others.

All the sprites/sounds are taken from the links provided in the above video, and are not owned by me. 
However, I did make quite a few changes in the code, where I found that I could improve the code at some places (eg: the score system, and adjusting the window for smaller screens), or just make it more to my liking at other places (eg: the opening screen).
Please let me know if you guys have any ideas to make this game more interesting!
I'd love to see your personal modifications to the code!
Have fun!
